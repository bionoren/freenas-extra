ISOs
----
You'll find a smattering of ISOs here marked with the version of java they contain (unmarked means the latest jre for the linux compatibility environment).
There is not, and will never be support for 32bit platforms.

Outside the Compatibility Environment
-------------------------------------
JTUX/JNA are required by Crashplan and provided here specifically for FreeBSD. They address a number of crashing bugs when using Crashplan natively on FreeBSD. In addition to replacing Crashplan's shipped files (being careful to preserve filenames), you should also modify bin/run.conf to contain the following:
-Dos.name=Linux
(optional; if your version of Java supports it) -Djava.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider=sun.nio.ch.KqueueSelectorProvider

You should delete libjtux64.so or symlink it to libjtux.so, which is already 64 bit.

The first flag is to tell Crashplan to pretend it's running on Linux and look for things in standard linux locations. The second flag tells Crashplan to watch the filesystem more intelligently on our platform (if your version of Java supports this, otherwise use the standard poll provider).
Additionally, you may need to symlink libc.so to libc.so.6:
ln -s /usr/lib/libc.so /usr/lib/libc.so.6

Debugging Tips
--------------
* Check engine_error.log and service.log.0 for exceptions and/or crashes. See Known Issues below.
* If Crashplan's JNA library is newer than the one provided, try building devel/jna on a FreeBSD computer and using the generated jar file.
* Every method of running Crashplan on FreeBSD has unresolved limitations. Be sure to check the issues list to see if the community is stuck too.
